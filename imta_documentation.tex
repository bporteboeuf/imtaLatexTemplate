%%%%%%%%%% PROJECT CREATION AND COMPILATION %%%%%%%%%% 

\section{Project creation and compilation}

\subsection{Project creation}

In order to use this template, create a new directory, and copy into it the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\item \imtaInlinecode{bash}{imta.tex}: this file declares all the data that composes the template.%
      It needs to be included to the main document, by calling \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\include{imta}}.
\item \imtaInlinecode{bash}{titlepage.pdf}: the title page of the document.%
      It is a blank version of the IMT Atlantique report template, over which an overlay title is written %
      by the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\imtaMaketitlepage} command.
\end{itemize}

Your document should be a \imtaInlinecode{bash}{.tex} file, with the following skeleton:

% Report skeleton
\begin{imtaCode}{latex}
\documentclass{article}

\include{imta}

\author{Author name}
\date{Writing date}
\title{Document name}
\subtitle{Short description or subtitle}

\begin{document}

\imtaMaketitlepage

\section{First section}

...

\end{document}

\end{imtaCode}
% Skeleton end


\subsection{Compilation}

This template is intended to be compiled with \imtaInlinecode{bash}{pdflatex}.
Furthermore, it makes use of the \imtaInlinecode{bash}{minted} package.
As a consequence, the compiler needs to be passed the \imtaInlinecode{bash}{-shell-escape} flag.
In addition, as usual when wishing a table of contents, the main document should be compiled twice, so as to make sure that the references refer to the right labels.
If your main document is called \imtaInlinecode{bash}{main.tex}, use the following command to compile it:

\begin{imtaConsole}
$ pdflatex -shell-escape main.tex
\end{imtaConsole}



%%%%%%%%%% PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%% 

\section{Packages}

This template uses a number of packages, with specific options.
Besides, some packages are further configured, through specific commands.
These can be found in the source code itself, at the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{PACKAGES SETTINGS} section.
The following is an abstract from the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{PACKAGES} section of the \imtaInlinecode{bash}{imta.tex} file.

\begin{imtaCode}{latex}

\usepackage[a4paper, margin=2cm, top=3cm]{geometry}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{minted}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{titling}
\usepackage{anyfontsize}
\usepackage{mdframed}

\end{imtaCode}

\subsection{\texttt{anyfontsize}}

The \imtaInlinecode{latex}{anyfontsize} package allows picking an arbitrary size for a local font.
It provides the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\fontsize} command, used for generating the title page inside of a \imtaInlinecode{latex}{tikzpicture} environment.

\subsection{\texttt{fancyhdr}}

The \imtaInlinecode{latex}{fancyhdr} package lets define custom headers and footers.
For instance, the IMT Atlantique header and footer style is defined as follows (inside of the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\imtaSetIMTStyle} command):

\begin{imtaCode}{latex}
\pagestyle{fancy}                       % Select the fancy style provided by fancyhdr

\fancyhead{}                            % Clear the current header style
\fancyfoot{}                            % Clear the current footer style

\fancyhead[L]{\nouppercase\leftmark}    % Define the content of the header:
                                        %     the current section title, on the left
\fancyfoot[R]{\thepage}                 % Define the content of the footer:
                                        %     the current page number, on the right

\fancypagestyle{imtaFirstpage}{%        % Define the style for the first page
    \fancyhf{}                          % Clear the current style
    \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}  % Clear the horizontal rule under the header
}
\end{imtaCode}

%%%%%%%%%% COMMANDS %%%%%%%%%% 

\section{Commands}

This template provides a handful of new commands.

\subsection{Generic commands}

\subsubsection{Metadata commands}

This template defines a \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\subtitle} macro, that receives the subtitle of the document.
The latter will be displayed on the title page.
The purpose of this macro is to provide a consistent way of defining a subtitle, with regard to the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\title}, %
\imtaInlinecode{latex}{\author}, and \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\date} standard macros.
It takes a single parameter, that is the subtitle to display.

\subsection{\texttt{imta} commands}

\subsubsection{Generating Covers}
-> about \texttt{imtaMakeTitle} and \texttt{imtaMakeCover}

\subsubsection{Additionnal document structuring}
-> about \texttt{imtaFrontMatter}, \texttt{imtaMainMatter}, \texttt{imtaUpperSectionNumber}, \texttt{imtaUpperSectionTitle}, \texttt{printup\-per\-sectioninlof} and \texttt{printuppersectioninlot}


\subsubsection{Typeset inline code with \texttt{imtaInlinecode}}

\subsubsection{Output the title page with \texttt{imtaMaketitlepage}}

\subsubsection{Answer questions with \texttt{imtaQuestion} and \texttt{imtaQuestionReset}}

The \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\imtaQuestion} command outputs and formats a question counter.
It's meant to be used in reports for assignment with questions.
The counter should be reset with the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\imtaQuestionReset}.
The output is as follows:

\imtaQuestion
Answer to first question

\imtaQuestion
Answer to second question

\imtaQuestionReset

\imtaQuestion
Answer to first question of the second section

\vspace{\baselineskip}
And the corresponding code:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\imtaQuestion
Answer to the first question

\imtaQuestion
Answer to the second question

\imtaQuestionReset

\imtaQuestion
Answer to the first question of the second section
\end{minted}



%%%%%%%%%% ENVIRONMENTS %%%%%%%%%% 

\section{Environments}

\subsection{Generic environments}

\subsubsection{Typeset code listings with \texttt{imtaCode}}

\begin{imtaCode}{cpp}
int a = 5;
\end{imtaCode}

\subsection{\texttt{imta} environments}

% \subsubsection{Typeset console sessions with \texttt{minted} and the \texttt{imtaConsole} style}
% 
% The \imtaInlinecode{latex}{imtaConsole} style for \imtaInlinecode{latex}{minted} provides a way to format console sessions.
% It outputs raw text in texttyper font, in a framed box.
% Here is an output example:
% 
% \begin{minted}{imtaConsole}
%     user@host:~$ mkdir newDirectory
%     user@host:~$ cd newDirectory
%     user@host:~$ touch newFile
% \end{minted}



%%%%%%%%%% STYLING %%%%%%%%%% 

\section{IMT Atlantique styling}

The official IMT Atlantique styling is not really \LaTeX-ish, and takes the decision to use a sans-serif font for body text.
Therefore, I chose to use the default \LaTeX{} font settings, which look much more professional.
Of course, this style does not suit the official report style.
Thus, I decided to provide a command that enables that official style.

The main aspects of the official style are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of the Helvetica font for the body;
    \item Section titles in green (\imtaInlinecode{latex}{\imtaGreen}) and other heading titles in gray (\imtaInlinecode{latex}{\imtaGray});
    \item Section title in the header;
    \item Page number at the right corner of the footer.
\end{itemize}

For comparison, the default style of the template is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of the default Computer Modern font for the body;
    \item Default style for headings: all in black;
    \item Document title at the left corner and author's name at the right corner of the header;
    \item Page number at the center of the footer.
\end{itemize}

The official IMT Atlantique style can be toggled with the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\imtaSetIMTStyle} command.
Since it makes use of the \imtaInlinecode{latex}{\usepackage} macro, it needs to be called in the preamble.
No way is provided to disable later in the document the official style.
As a consequence, you cannot have half of the document with the official style, and the other half in the default style.
